Recovered Zoop mod, originally created by **Elmotrix** and later advanced by **jixxed**. This mod has been updated from **Katsuk**'s version.

Allows you to build long lines of cables, pipes, or chutes between two points in a single action.  
Lines cannot exceed the quantity of building materials in hand.  
Waypoints can be added to extend the length of cables.

## Additions:
- Fix for completion time, ensuring consistency in subsequent building actions.
- Bindable keys.
- Soft dependency on the CreativeFreedom mod, enabling cross-device zooping without collision checks.
- Increased stack size for cables (250), pipes (100), and chutes (50).

## Usage:
While in construction mode, hold **Left Shift** _(by default)_ and press the primary action, then move the mouse to zoop. Hold primary to complete.  
Alternatively, press **Z** _(by default)_ once to start zooping without hold+click.  
You can add a waypoint by pressing **mouse middle-click** _(by default)_ and cancel the last one with **V** _(by default)_.

All keys can be customized in the Stationeers settings.
